# BATTERY THERMAL MANAGEMENT USING HEATPIPES INTEGRATED DI-ELCTRIC LIQUID IMMERSION COOLING SYSYEM

### **Overview**

The thermal management of batteries is crucial for enhancing their performance, lifespan, and safety. This research introduces an innovative Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS) that leverages heat pipe integrated immersion cooling to control battery temperature and maintain uniform thermal distribution across the entire battery pack.

### **Key Features**

- Heat Pipe Integration: Utilizes heat pipes with a dielectric fluid medium in lithium-ion battery packs to efficiently absorb and dissipate heat.
- Nanofluid Enhancement: Incorporates acetone and acetone with Al2O3 and CuO nanofluids with various filling ratios to optimize heat pipe performance.
- Peltier Cooling System: Rapidly dissipates heat from the condenser section during high charge and discharge cycles (high “C” values).
- Performance Analysis
- Simulates the performance and heat transfer characteristics of the heat pipe in an immersion cooling system under actual operating conditions.
- Analytical results indicate that this integrated system provides superior thermal stability, although limited experimental studies have been conducted in BTMS.

### **Benefits**

- Ensures optimal thermal stability and extends battery life.
- Suitable for applications requiring high energy density and power density.
- Provides practical and efficient thermal management solutions for lithium-ion batteries.

### **Conclusion**
This hybrid thermal management system represents a significant advancement in battery technology, offering enhanced thermal management and extended performance. It is ideal for various high-demand applications, ensuring the safe and efficient operation of lithium-ion batteries.
